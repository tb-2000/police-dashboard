# police-dashboard
In this project, I am implementing a Streamlit application that displays a police dashboard. 

The police data comes from the Baltimore Police Department and is stored in a csv file. To use the app, the ZIP file crimes.zip must be unzipped into the ./data folder.

To open the app, use the following command in the command line: streamlit run ./your/path/to/dashboard.py
